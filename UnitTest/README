Here is code for testing aspects of modules, including files with a "topEntity"
that can be used to create VHDL to test the code either in an FPGA or in a
simulation tool such as QuestaSim. To that end, there are also CÎ»aSH
testbenches through the use of testInput and expectedOutput.

While named "unit test", the tests cover more than just strictly one unit and
are more generally targeted at code development.

The hierarchical structure mimicks the root structure, with UnitTest as the
top-level module. For example:

X/Y.hs
UnitTest/X/Y.hs    -- Tests for X.Y
UnitTest/X/Y/Z.hs  -- Tests specific to some aspect Z of the module X.Y, often
                      in the form of a topEntity.
